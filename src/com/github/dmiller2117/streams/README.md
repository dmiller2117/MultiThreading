# Stream API Explained

- Streams started in Java 8
- Streams introduce functional programming to the Java programming ecosystem
    - In computer science, functional programming is a paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing
      functions
- Streams rely heavily on Lambda expressions
- We can construct parallel operations in streams
    - Lambda expression are similar to methods, but they do not need a name, and they can be implemented right in the
      body of a method.
