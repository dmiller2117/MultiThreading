# Dining Philosophers Problem

- It was formulated by Dijkstra in 1965
- 5 philosophers are present at a table and there are 5 forks(chopsticks)
- The philosophers can eat and think
- Philosophers can eat when they have both left and right chopsticks
- A chopstick can be held by one philosopher at a given time
- The problem: **how to create and algorithm** such that so each philosopher will not starve? (so the aim is to avoid deadlock)
